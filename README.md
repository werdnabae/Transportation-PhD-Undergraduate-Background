# Disciplinary Entry Pathways into Transportation PhD Training

This repository contains data and analysis code for a study of **undergraduate disciplinary entry pathways** into transportation focused PhD training housed in U.S. civil engineering departments.


This paper uses the same dataset as this paper: https://github.com/werdnabae/Transportation-PhD-Recruitment

## Data Description

The dataset links transportation focused civil engineering faculty advisors to their PhD students using publicly available information collected in late 2025. All personally identifying information has been removed.

Advisor student relationships are recorded from public materials during data collection. We do not infer advising ties from coauthorship or other indirect signals.

Key fields include:

* Institution
* Role (advisor or student)
* Undergraduate major (coded into grouped categories)
* Basic program and roster metadata used for linking

## Analysis

The Jupyter notebook reproduces the analyses reported in the accompanying paper, including:

* Aggregate undergraduate pathway composition
* Program level intake diversity summaries
* Advisor level recruitment concentration summaries
* Descriptive matching patterns by grouped undergraduate major

The notebook is designed to be run end to end.

## Reproducibility

All results in the associated paper can be reproduced using the anonymized dataset and analysis notebook in this repository. No proprietary or confidential data are used.
